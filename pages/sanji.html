              "Black Leg" Sanji, born as Vinsmoke Sanji, is the cook of the
              Straw Hat Pirates. He is the fifth member of the crew and the
              fourth to join, doing so at the end of the Baratie Arc. Born as
              the third son and fourth child of the Vinsmoke Family (thus making
              him a prince of the Germa Kingdom), he disowned his family twice,
              once in his youth and again after reuniting with them as an adult.
              After fleeing the Vinsmokes as a child, he eventually entered the
              care of Zeff as the sous chef of the Baratie, where he would
              remain until he met Luffy, who convinced him to join his crew.
